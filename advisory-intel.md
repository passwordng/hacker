## Ransomware In Nigeria – The Lessons We Did Not Learn

‘No official information yet, but we have seen some leakage of alleged compromise of a certain Nigeria organization as released by a ransomware threat group in the dark web” – This was a statement from a member of the Whitehat.NG telegram platform. This was in the afternoon of April 16th, 2023. 

And further instruction was shared on how those with internet-facing assets should ensure visibility across them, and most importantly validate any form of existing relationship with the current alleged victim of this new incident, to prevent the spread and possible exploitation of third-party relationships as seen in previous ransomware-related incidents. Tips and recommendations that can help were further shared in the course of this writing.
As a group of professionals, those with privileged access started digging for more information as per this release dated April 15th, 2023 from the dark web and other data to ensure the statement issued by the threat group is not just some bluff, as shown below.

A little background from what we know before this time….
A week earlier, we got some intel and notification of intrusion on certain facilities which has to do with the usage of Cobalt Strike in its post-exploitation as documented by the CyberPlural’s Team. This introduced a couple of questions as to whether the country is being targeted towards this time as a similar incident had been previously captured by the team in 2022, just a few days after the Bet9ja incident became news. 
Basically in 2022, the following happened;
-	Bet9ja Ransomware Incident 
-	ALPHV / Blackcat was stated to be responsible
-	Cobalt Strike Post-Exploitation Tool observed around certain facilities in Nigeria. 
- Bet9ja was updating stakeholders on their progress throughout the incident, and providing assurance to customers on their progress to restoring.

Cobalt strike is a legitimate and powerful post-exploitation tool known for its abuse by cybercriminals targeting organizations’ networks and always part of the tools used in the MOs for this particular ransomware group that is getting their second public hit in Nigeria (ALPHV / Blackcat). And it will interest you to know that FBI documentation carrying the MOs of this ransomware group captured it as shown below.
